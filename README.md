# Exultate Custom Theme
__A Custom Wordpress Theme__

This is a custom theme for the Exultate Chamber Choir and Orchestra
in Minneapolis, MN. It's built on top of the Bones Development Theme by
Eddie Machado and integrates the Advanced Custom Fields plugin for 
custom metadata goodness. I promise to write a more thorough readme
once I'm back from vacation!
